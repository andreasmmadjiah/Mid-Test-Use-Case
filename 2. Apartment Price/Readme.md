# EDA and Regression Apartment victoria.csv
<br>
<br>
We are using victoria.csv which is data about apartment list and features and its price. We try to predict price by input apartment's
list and features. First, we clean our data and EDA to find which variables that is important to our model. Also, we use Multiple Linear 
Regression and use p-value to determine which variabel that is inputted to our model. Last, we compute our model's performance. In the optional section
we use train test split to also train our multiple linear regression.

After we see which variables is important, we can use only these important variables to determine price of the apartment.
