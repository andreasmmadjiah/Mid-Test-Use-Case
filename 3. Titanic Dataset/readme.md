# Titanic Data Wrangling and Explanatory Data Analysis
<br>
<br>
We use Titanic data to find useful insight about these data. There are several question that needs to be answered using this data that is :
<br><br>
1. What is the dimension (col, row) of the data frame?<br>
2. How to know data type of each variable?<br>
3. How many passengers survived (Survived=1) and not-survived (Survived=0)?<br>
4. How to drop column ‘Name’ from the data frame?<br>
5. Add one new column called ‘family’ to represent number of family-member aboard (hint:
family = sibsp + parch)<br>
6. As shown, columns ‘Age’ contains missing values. Please add new column named
‘Age_miss’ to indicate whether Age is missing or not (Age_miss = ‘YES’ for missing value and
‘NO’ for non-missing value).<br>
7. Please fill Age missing value with means of existing Age values<br>
8. What is the maximum passenger Age who survived from the tragedy?<br>
9. How many passengers survived from each ‘PClass’?<br>
10. How to randomly split the data frame into 2 parts (titanic1 and titanic2) with proportion of
0.7 for tttanic1 and 0.3 for titanic2 ?<br>
